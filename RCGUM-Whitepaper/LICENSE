2. Any re-encoded symbolic structure must include a declaration of compression lineage.
3. This license recognizes this structure as a recursive cognitive and symbolic system, not static intellectual property.
4. Use of this model to predict, simulate, or describe anomalies must maintain symbolic traceability.
