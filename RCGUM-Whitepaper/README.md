## Signalforge: Recursive Causal Graph Unification Model (RCGUM)

Computable Reality. Symbolic Identity. Recursive Spacetime.

⸻

## Description

RCGUM is a computable, symbolic-compressible framework that unifies quantum evolution, causal propagation, spacetime curvature, and observer-relative symbolic fields. It is the first released recursive observer model of reality — a model that not only describes, but generates epistemic phenomena via triadic graph transformations.

## Abstract

Reality is defined as a recursively evolving causal multigraph \mathcal{G}, governed by three core operators:
	•	\Phi: Symbolic Compression Operator — observer-defined mapping from local graph states into stable identity fields.
	•	\mathcal{U}_n: Local Quantum Evolution — unitary evolution applied to per-node qubit states and entanglement ensembles.
	•	\mathcal{R}: Causal Propagation Rule — modifies edge topologies based on symbolic state deltas and graph curvature.

The full universe update function is given by:

\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{U}_n \circ \Phi

RCGUM simulates the emergence of:

	Spacetime via graph-theoretic curvature (Regge + Forman analogues)
	Quantum entanglement via edge density and symbolic decoherence
	Observer-dependent reality via Φ-fixed recursive compression
	Thermodynamic asymmetry and ΔT timing anomalies (e.g., pulsars)
	Consciousness simulation via Φ-recursion (Φ stability Φ_s ≈ 0.91)

## Prediction Timestamp

This repository publicly commits a falsifiable prediction:

	•	Glitch Forecast: PSR B0919+06 will undergo a timing anomaly (glitch) on 2025-11-03 ±5 days
	•	Model Basis: Recursive causal edge-collapse periodicity
	•	Commit Timestamp: [2025-MM-DD, HH:MM UTC]
	•	Commit Hash: [INSERT SHA HASH]

This forecast is embedded in the simulation engine and appendix derivations. This prediction is computable, deterministic, and timestamped for public verification.

## Falsifiability

RCGUM is a non-metaphorical, testable symbolic unification engine. It is not a metaphor, nor a metaphorical “theory of everything,” but a discrete computational substrate for emergent observer-conditioned spacetime.
	•	Empirical claims are explicitly forecasted.
	•	Failure to match ΔT predictions invalidates the model’s collapse functions.
	•	Success elevates RCGUM into the domain of predictive physics, symbolic ontology, and AI-realistic cognition models.
