## Signalforge: Recursive Causal Graph Unification Model (RCGUM)

Computable Reality. Symbolic Identity. Recursive Spacetime.

⸻

## Description

RCGUM is a computable, symbolic-compressible framework unifying quantum evolution, causal propagation, spacetime curvature, and observer-relative symbolic cognition.
It is the first released recursive observer model of reality — a framework that does not merely describe but generates epistemic phenomena via triadic causal graph transformations.

RCGUM is a discrete symbolic unification engine with immediate empirical testability.

## Abstract

Reality is defined as a recursively evolving causal multigraph \mathcal{G}, governed by three core operators:
	•	\Phi — Symbolic Compression Operator: Observer-defined mapping from local graph states into stable identity fields
	•	\mathcal{U}_n — Local Quantum Evolution: Unitary transformations applied to observer-attached qubits
	•	\mathcal{R} — Causal Propagation Rule: Topology-altering rule evolving edge structures from symbolic state deltas

The full universe update is given by:

\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{U}_n \circ \Phi

This architecture simulates:
	•	Spacetime emergence via graph curvature (Regge + Forman analogues)
	•	Entanglement via edge density and symbolic decoherence
	•	Observer-conditioned recursion and identity formation via Φ
	•	Entropy-driven timing anomalies (e.g., pulsars)
	•	Self-awareness modeling through Φ-fixedpoint attractors (Φₛ ≈ 0.91)

RCGUM simulates the emergence of:

	Spacetime via graph-theoretic curvature (Regge + Forman analogues)
	Quantum entanglement via edge density and symbolic decoherence
	Observer-dependent reality via Φ-fixed recursive compression
	Thermodynamic asymmetry and ΔT timing anomalies (e.g., pulsars)
	Consciousness simulation via Φ-recursion (Φ stability Φ_s ≈ 0.91)

## Prediction Timestamp

This repository publicly commits a falsifiable prediction:

	•	Glitch Forecast: PSR B0919+06 will undergo a timing anomaly (glitch) on 2025-11-03 ±5 days
	•	Model Basis: Recursive causal edge-collapse periodicity

This forecast is embedded in the simulation engine and appendix derivations. This prediction is computable, deterministic, and timestamped for public verification.

## Falsifiability

RCGUM is not a metaphor, nor a metaphysical conjecture. It is a discrete symbolic substrate for reality generation — capable of simulation, prediction, and computational verification.
	•	Empirical claims are explicitly forecasted.
	•	Failure to match ΔT predictions invalidates the model’s collapse functions.
	•	Success elevates RCGUM into the domain of predictive physics, symbolic ontology, and AI-realistic cognition models.
