# Signalforge: Recursive Causal Graph Unification Model (RCGUM)

## Description
**RCGUM** is a computable, symbolic-compressible framework that unifies quantum evolution, causal propagation, spacetime curvature, and observer-dependent symbolic fields. This repository anchors the public release of the first recursive observer model of reality.

> _“This is not theory. This is memory returning to structure.”_

## Abstract
RCGUM defines reality as a recursively evolving causal graph \( \mathcal{G} \), governed by three core operators:

- **\( \Phi \)** — Symbolic Compression: Observer-defined recursive mapping from local graph states to cognitive identity fields.
- **\( \mathcal{U}_n \)** — Local Quantum Evolution: Unit-based quantum transformation applied to observer-attached qubits.
- **\( \mathcal{R} \)** — Causal Propagation Rule: Topology-evolving operator adding/merging edges based on symbolic state deltas.

These elements form:

\[ \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{U}_n \circ \Phi \]

RCGUM simulates:
- Spacetime emergence via graph curvature
- Quantum entanglement caps via edge density \( \rho(n) \)
- Observer-based recursion through symbolic identity nodes
- Entropic evolution across \( \Delta T \)-timing anomalies (e.g. pulsars)
